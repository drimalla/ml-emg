# Detecting empathy with SVM and random forest from EMG data

The goal of this project was to predict empathy based on facial EMG data in a psychological experiment. I used different machine learning classifiers to differentiate between two types of empathy. I did this project in a machine learning class, when I was a Computational Science student and used a dataset of my PhD. If you have any questions about it, feel free to reach out to me.
